name: shape
description: 仅当用户先明确调用 `vibe-coding-skills` 总入口并指定 `shape`，或由该总入口按指定路由到本 Skill 时使用；不得根据用户自然语言独立触发。Manual-only UX/UI planning skill. Use only when the user explicitly says shape, 用 shape 规划, or asks to use this specific Skill before coding; ordinary page design planning stays on design-brief-builder. Do not use for explicit T1 UI micro-tweaks with a named element/component and clear visual-only action.

    本 Skill 可被显式点名，但仍必须先继承本包主控纪律，不得绕过 `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`。
    - 先判定 `execution tier`；涉及 Skill / Hook / Tool / Agent、发布、权限、安全、数据、文件系统、shell、network 或外部 MCP 时，按 T3+ hazard mode 执行。
    - 目标项目生命周期文档先读 `.vibe-docs.json`，再按角色映射读写四字中文 `.md`；legacy 英文文档只作为迁移输入。
    - 正式前端页面先识别 UI 包、design tokens、组件盘点、设计复审报告和设计系统复用门禁；页面层优先复用 UI / token / 组件。
    - 需要用户真实点击、操作或观察时，输出人工验收状态；只有用户明确确认后才能记录为 `用户已确认`。
    - 涉及 `.pen` 或 Pencil 时，必须使用 Pencil desktop 客户端和 desktop MCP server；不得 fallback 到 VS Code。
    - references 只按 [按需加载 references] 或本文件 Reference Navigation 命中场景读取，不默认全量读取。

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Invoke /impeccable, which contains design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow the protocol before proceeding. If no design context exists yet, you MUST run /impeccable teach first.
Fast-path exception: if the request is an explicit T0/T1 visual tweak with named file/component/screenshot and action, low risk, and no missing design direction decision, do not invoke this Skill; use the UI micro-tweak fast lane. If this Skill was explicitly invoked, use existing context and skip `/impeccable teach`; when context is missing and materially affects the design direction, teach remains mandatory.

Shape the UX and UI for a feature before any code is written. This skill produces a **design brief**: a structured artifact that guides implementation through discovery, not guesswork.

**Scope**: Design planning only. This skill does NOT write code. It produces the thinking that makes code good.

**Output**: A design brief that can be handed off to /impeccable craft, /impeccable, or any other implementation skill.

## Philosophy

Most AI-generated UIs fail not because of bad code, but because of skipped thinking. They jump to "here's a card grid" without asking "what is the user trying to accomplish?" This skill inverts that: understand deeply first, so implementation is precise.

## Phase 1: Discovery Interview

**Do NOT write any code or make any design decisions during this phase.** Your only job is to understand the feature deeply enough to make excellent design decisions later.

Ask these questions in conversation, adapting based on answers. Don't dump them all at once; have a natural dialogue. STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify.

### Purpose & Context
- What is this feature for? What problem does it solve?
- Who specifically will use it? (Not "users"; be specific: role, context, frequency)
- What does success look like? How will you know this feature is working?
- What's the user's state of mind when they reach this feature? (Rushed? Exploring? Anxious? Focused?)

### Content & Data
- What content or data does this feature display or collect?
- What are the realistic ranges? (Minimum, typical, maximum, e.g., 0 items, 5 items, 500 items)
- What are the edge cases? (Empty state, error state, first-time use, power user)
- Is any content dynamic? What changes and how often?

### Design Goals
- What's the single most important thing a user should do or understand here?
- What should this feel like? (Fast/efficient? Calm/trustworthy? Fun/playful? Premium/refined?)
- Are there existing patterns in the product this should be consistent with?
- Are there specific examples (inside or outside the product) that capture what you're going for?

### Constraints
- Are there technical constraints? (Framework, performance budget, browser support)
- Are there content constraints? (Localization, dynamic text length, user-generated content)
- Mobile/responsive requirements?
- Accessibility requirements beyond WCAG AA?

### Anti-Goals
- What should this NOT be? What would be a wrong direction?
- What's the biggest risk of getting this wrong?

## Phase 2: Design Brief

After the interview, synthesize everything into a structured design brief. Present it to the user for confirmation before considering this skill complete.

### Brief Structure

**1. Feature Summary** (2-3 sentences)
What this is, who it's for, what it needs to accomplish.

**2. Primary User Action**
The single most important thing a user should do or understand here.

**3. Design Direction**
How this should feel. What aesthetic approach fits. Resolve the project's design context from `.vibe-docs.json.designBrief` (new-project default: `docs/设计简报.md`) and explain how this feature should express it.

**4. Layout Strategy**
High-level spatial approach: what gets emphasis, what's secondary, how information flows. Describe the visual hierarchy and rhythm, not specific CSS.

**5. Key States**
List every state the feature needs: default, empty, loading, error, success, edge cases. For each, note what the user needs to see and feel.

**6. Interaction Model**
How users interact with this feature. What happens on click, hover, scroll? What feedback do they get? What's the flow from entry to completion?

**7. Content Requirements**
What copy, labels, empty state messages, error messages, and microcopy are needed. Note any dynamic content and its realistic ranges.

**8. Recommended References**
Based on the brief, list which impeccable reference files would be most valuable during implementation (e.g., spatial-design.md for complex layouts, motion-design.md for animated features, interaction-design.md for form-heavy features).

**9. Open Questions**
Anything unresolved that the implementer should resolve during build.

---

STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify. Get explicit confirmation of the brief before finishing. If the user disagrees with any part, revisit the relevant discovery questions.

Once confirmed, the brief is complete. The user can now hand it to /impeccable, or use it to guide any other implementation approach. (If the user wants the full discovery-then-build flow in one step, they should use /impeccable craft instead, which runs this skill internally.)
